    "# Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "Ans.\n",
    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that enables \n",
    "efficient retrieval, updating, and analysis of the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "MySQl: MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. As with other relational databases, \n",
    "MySQL stores data in tables made up of rows and columns. Users can define, manipulate, control, and query data \n",
    "using Structured Query Language, more commonly known as SQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL: NoSQL databases are non-tabular databases and store data differently than relational tables.\n",
    "NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column,\n",
    "and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads."
